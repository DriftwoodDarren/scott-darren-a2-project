Second assignment for Game Development Foundations - GAME 10003-02

This program is a Skull that follows your cursor but only when the left mouse button is held down. 
The program also has a barrier that prevents the skull from leaving the border of the window. 

This is a very simple inteeractive drawing, I couldn't really figure out how to do more complex interactions so this is all I have for now.
